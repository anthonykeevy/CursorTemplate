# Event Registration System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 29, 2025  
**Status:** Draft for Review

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **User Goal:** Event organizers can create professional registration forms with custom background images in under 10 minutes
- **User Goal:** Attendees can complete registration forms seamlessly on any device with 95%+ completion rate
- **User Goal:** Event organizers can export registration data to CSV format instantly without technical complexity
- **Business Goal:** Achieve 100+ event organizers using the system within 3 months
- **Business Goal:** Process 1,000+ registrations in the first 6 months with 90%+ satisfaction rate
- **Technical Goal:** Build a lightweight Python web application with file-based storage and responsive design
- **Technical Goal:** Implement secure background image upload and serving functionality
- **Quality Goal:** Ensure 100% successful CSV generation and cross-platform compatibility

### Background Context

The Event Registration System addresses a critical gap in the event management landscape where organizers face a binary choice between overly complex enterprise solutions and basic generic forms that lack visual customization. Current solutions like Google Forms and SurveyMonkey provide functionality but fail to deliver the professional presentation and event-specific branding that organizers need to create engaging registration experiences.

The system leverages Python's simplicity and the existing development environment to create a lightweight web application that eliminates technical barriers while providing essential visual customization through background image uploads. This approach transforms event registration from a technical challenge into a simple, visually appealing process that enhances both organizer efficiency and attendee experience.
