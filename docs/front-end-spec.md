## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the Event Registration System's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

**Event Organizer (Primary):**
- Small to medium event organizers, community leaders, meetup organizers
- Limited technical expertise, values simplicity and professional presentation
- Needs quick setup, visual customization, and easy data management
- Goals: Professional event branding, efficient attendee management, reliable data export

**Event Attendee (Secondary):**
- General public registering for events
- Expects smooth, professional registration experience
- Values clear information, easy form completion, and confirmation
- Goals: Quick registration, clear event information, confirmation of successful registration

#### Usability Goals

- **Ease of Learning:** New organizers can set up a registration form in under 10 minutes
- **Efficiency of Use:** Attendees can complete registration in under 2 minutes
- **Error Prevention:** Clear validation and immediate feedback for all form interactions
- **Professional Presentation:** Visual design enhances event branding and credibility
- **Accessibility:** WCAG AA compliance ensures inclusive user experience
- **Mobile Optimization:** Seamless experience across all device sizes

#### Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First** - Prioritize clarity and ease of use over feature complexity
2. **Visual Customization** - Background images should enhance, not hinder, user experience
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show only essential information, reveal details as needed
4. **Immediate Feedback** - Every action should have clear, instant response
5. **Accessible by Default** - Design for all users from the start, not as an afterthought
6. **Professional Polish** - Clean, modern aesthetic that reflects event quality

    D1 --> D1a[Registration List]
    D1 --> D1b[Statistics]
    D1 --> D1c[Search/Filter]
```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** Simple, minimal navigation focused on core functions - Setup, Registration, and Management

**Secondary Navigation:** Contextual navigation within each section (e.g., image management within setup)

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Clear breadcrumbs for multi-step processes, especially in setup and management flows

---

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Event Setup and Configuration

**User Goal:** Event organizer sets up registration form with custom background image

**Entry Points:** Landing page, direct setup URL

**Success Criteria:** Registration form is live and accessible with custom background

**Flow Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Landing Page] --> B[Setup Welcome]
    B --> C[Background Image Upload]
    C --> D{Image Valid?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Image Preview]
    D -->|No| F[Error Message]
    F --> C
    E --> G[Form Configuration]
    G --> H[Setup Complete]
    H --> I[Registration Form Live]
    
    C --> C1[Drag & Drop]
    C --> C2[File Browser]
    C --> C3[URL Input]
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- Invalid file format (show supported formats)
- File too large (show size limit and compression options)
- Upload failure (retry mechanism)
- Network connectivity issues (offline handling)

**Notes:** Focus on visual feedback and progress indication throughout the setup process

### Flow 2: Event Registration

**User Goal:** Attendee completes registration form successfully

**Entry Points:** Public registration URL, QR code, email link

**Success Criteria:** Registration data saved, confirmation shown

**Flow Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Registration Form] --> B[Form Display]
    B --> C[User Input]
    C --> D[Real-time Validation]
    D --> E{Valid Input?}
    E -->|No| F[Error Display]
    F --> C
    E -->|Yes| G[Submit Form]
    G --> H[Loading State]
    H --> I{Submission Success?}
    I -->|No| J[Error Handling]
    J --> C
    I -->|Yes| K[Success Confirmation]
    K --> L[Email Confirmation]
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- Form validation errors (clear, specific messages)
- Network timeout (retry with progress indication)
- Duplicate submissions (prevent and inform)
- Browser compatibility issues (graceful degradation)

**Notes:** Ensure form is accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers

### Flow 3: Data Management and Export

**User Goal:** Event organizer accesses registration data and exports to CSV

**Entry Points:** Management dashboard, direct management URL

**Success Criteria:** CSV file downloaded with complete registration data

**Flow Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Management Dashboard] --> B[View Registrations]
    B --> C[Registration List]
    C --> D[Search/Filter]
    D --> E[Export Options]
    E --> F[Generate CSV]
    F --> G[Download File]
    G --> H[Export Complete]
    
    C --> C1[Registration Details]
    C --> C2[Statistics View]
    C --> C3[Data Backup]
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- Large dataset export (progress indication)
- Export failure (retry mechanism)
- File download issues (alternative download methods)
- Data corruption (backup and recovery)

**Notes:** Provide clear feedback on export progress and file location

## Responsiveness Strategy

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Mobile | 320px | 767px | Smartphones, small tablets |
| Tablet | 768px | 1023px | Tablets, large phones |
| Desktop | 1024px | 1439px | Laptops, small desktops |
| Wide | 1440px | - | Large desktops, monitors |

### Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes:** Single column on mobile, multi-column on larger screens

**Navigation Changes:** Hamburger menu on mobile, horizontal navigation on desktop

**Content Priority:** Essential content first, progressive enhancement for larger screens

**Interaction Changes:** Touch-friendly on mobile, hover states on desktop

---

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles
- **Purposeful:** Every animation serves a clear purpose
- **Smooth:** 60fps animations with appropriate easing
- **Accessible:** Respect user motion preferences
- **Fast:** Quick, responsive interactions

### Key Animations
- **Form Validation:** Subtle shake for errors, smooth checkmark for success (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Button States:** Smooth hover and focus transitions (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Page Transitions:** Fade in/out for page changes (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Loading States:** Skeleton screens and progress indicators (Duration: 1000ms, Easing: linear)
- **Image Upload:** Progress bar and preview fade-in (Duration: 500ms, Easing: ease-out)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals
- **Page Load:** Under 3 seconds on 3G connection
- **Interaction Response:** Under 100ms for user interactions
- **Animation FPS:** 60fps for all animations

### Design Strategies
- Optimize images for web display
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical content
- Use CSS transforms for animations
- Minimize layout shifts with proper sizing
- Progressive enhancement for core functionality
